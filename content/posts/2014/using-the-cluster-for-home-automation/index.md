Some of you might be wondering "why doesn't he write more blogs about the cluster?" and I wouldn't blame you. I have a pretty good reason for not blogging about the pi cluster (even though I promised sample code). That reason is "home automation". As some of you might know I'm big into home automation, and have done quite a bit already. But it's always fun to try something different!

I usually use single or double relay boards which you can control with an arduino or a Raspberry pi. This time however I ordered an 8 relay board instead of a double relay board. I got the board from China at a store called "Sainsmart", here's the link to the exact board I got: [http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-dc-5v-relay-module-for-arduino-pic-arm-dsp-avr-msp430-ttl-logic.html](http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-dc-5v-relay-module-for-arduino-pic-arm-dsp-avr-msp430-ttl-logic.html)

So what does that have to do with the cluster you ask? Well, I used to have a Raspberry pi to experiment with.... But I used that in the cluster to save some money. (here I was, thinking to be smart!) So I had to "disassemble"(taking the top off) the cluster to connect the relay board. In the next blog-post I'll have a couple of pictures showing off the relay board and the pi cluster.

## I donated a pi!

While talking on IRC with a friend[(Robbie Ferguson)](http://baldnerd.com) of mine I discovered that he had never used a Raspberry pi before. And to make matters worse he told me he had lost interest in them now. When I asked why he never got one he told me the following:

> When they were new I couldn't get one here in Canada, and now it's been so long that I've lost interest.

While discussing the fact he jokingly told me, if you'll send me one I'll try it out. A small problem arose though, me sending a pi to Canada would cost way more than actually buying one over there. So we decided that I'd just send him the money and he would order his own. I can't wait to see what he does with it.
If you guys are interested in seeing what he does with it too you can check out [Category5.tv](http://www.category5.tv/)

What Robbie doesn't know is that I wanted to do something for the show / him anyways. I was originally planning on just donating $20, but giving him the joy that comes from owning a Raspberry pi seemed like a way better plan! Besides, he's been working really really hard on the new Studio D so he deserves some fun!

## Kickstarter monitoring

I have once more decided to back a certain Kickstarter campaign and find myself checking the website **a lot**. I plan to change this by creating a little script (don't know which language yet) that will check it for me and report back. More info about this project to come.
