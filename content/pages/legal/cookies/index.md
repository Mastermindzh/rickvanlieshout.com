A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on the client
computer (your computer) to make the website function better. Some
examples of what cookies are used for:

- Remembering what language the website should be in
- Storing your cart when shopping online
- Keeping you logged in

There are also cookies that are not explicitly set by the website
owner themselves. These are often introduced when websites include
projects which have been made by other people. Some of these
include:

- Disqus - A comment system for your website
- Google analytics - To track info about the website (i.e how many times each page has been seen)
- Social media (twitter, facebook, etc) - To add in those shiny "like" or "tweet" buttons.

Cookies like these are stored for pretty much every website you
visit and they make the World Wide Web what it is today.

Since mid 2015 every website which is either hosted in Europe or
targets the European market is required to inform and get consent from
users about using cookies. This is usually done with a bar at the
bottom of the page which can be dismissed with a simple button. More
information about the legislation around the cookie law can be found
[here](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/WEBGUIDE/04.+Cookies+and+similar+technologies).
