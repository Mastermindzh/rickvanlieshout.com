## Work experience

**Open-source aficionado**<br />
_Always_<br />
A fair share of my private work is done through open-source media. I don't have a portfolio but I have a [Github](https://github.com/mastermindzh) where I share most things.

**Tech lead / CTO at INFORIT**<br />
_2018 - Now_<br />
At INFORIT I am responsible for the entire technical architecture of the new TFX stack that I launched shortly after 2018. This involves setting up and maintaining a modern event-based microservice architecture on a Kubernetes-based SaaS cloud solution and migrating to modern programming languages such as dotnetcore and React.

The other main responsibility I have is creating and maintaining a coherent team of lead developers by sharing knowledge, making decisions, and empowering leads to explore technologies outside of their comfort zone.

At INFORIT I also help with the recruitment of new employees, setting up and maintaining agile strategies including proper test management, and general software development.
During my time at INFORIT, we've grown from 5-7 in-house developers to 10, full-sized, SCRUM teams.

Most relevant technologies used: dotnetcore, React, Angular, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Mongo, PostgreSQL, Growthbook, Docker & Kubernetes

**Hanflex employee**<br />
_September 2015 - July 2018_<br />
I started working for the HAN (hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen) in 2015. The HAN offers us different jobs (teaching others, open door days, etc) and we are free to reply and take those. I primarily respond to the open-door days and the teaching jobs. On the open-door days, I usually work with 3d printers and a laser cutter.

**mi-soft.nl**<br />
_2006 - January 2019_<br />
I started my own "company" helping people with their PC issues.
This ranged from fixing the hardware & software of home computers, installing home & corporate networks to developing software and websites.

## Education

**HBO ICT / software engineering HAN - Nijmegen**<br />
_2014 - 2018_<br />
After a few rocky years I enrolled in college and I'm now trying to get a software engineering degree. I finished my first year with an average of 8.3/10 and will graduate in mid-2018.

**Bilingual Senior General Secondary Education - Maaslandcollege Oss**<br />
