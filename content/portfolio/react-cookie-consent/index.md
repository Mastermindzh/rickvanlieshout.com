React-cookie-consent is a small, simple and customizable cookie consent bar for use in React applications.
The bar can be used in most React versions and related frameworks (Gatsby, Next). A React Native version is not available.
`react-cookie-consent` is highly customizable and actively maintained on Github. <br />
It's bundled up as an npm module so installing it is as easy as:

```sh
npm install react-cookie-consent
```

I initially built react-cookie-consent because I couldn't find a decent cookie-bar to use for this website. After building it I decided to share it with the community so others don't have to create their own.
